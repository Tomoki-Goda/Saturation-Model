abstract = {We discuss corrections to the leading-log Q2 relationships between the gluon density g(x, Q2) and FL(x, Q2), ∂FT(x, Q2)/∂ log Q2 in the HERA range of large 1x. We find that the above quantities probe the gluon density g(x, QT,L2) at QT,L2 = CT,LQ2, with the Q2-rescaling factors CT ≈ 2.2 and CL ≈ 0.42. The possibility of treating charm as an active flavour is critically re-examined.}
