    abstract = { We update the well-known BLNY fit to the low transverse momentum Drell–Yan lepton pair productions in hadronic collisions, by considering the constraints from the semi-inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) from HERMES and COMPASS experiments. We follow the Collins–Soper–Sterman (CSS) formalism with the b∗-prescription. A nonperturbative form factor associated with the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions is found in the analysis with a new functional form different from that of BLNY. This releases the tension between the BLNY fit to the Drell–Yan data with the SIDIS data from HERMES/COMPASS in the CSS resummation formalism. }
