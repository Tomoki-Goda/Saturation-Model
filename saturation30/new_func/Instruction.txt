this program can be run in the following steps.

1. make directory ./dir 
2. in that directory copy control.h from ./new_funcs/
3. compile 
	gcc Automatic_Run -o Automatic_Run
4. run 
	./Automatic_Run "./dir"


./Automatic_Run will take multiple directories for parallel computation.

4. For multiple runs inparallel prepare individual directory for each setting and one directory <DIR> to put those directories.

and run 
	./Automatic_Run ./DIR/*
	
5. then something like 
	./makelist 3 ./GBW/*massless*/result.txt ./GBW/massless.txt
to produce latex list. (see makelist.c for syntax)

alternatively, use makelist-all.sh 
change "alldir" and 'dir' appropriately.


6. For plotting, 
compile Auto-Plot-DP.c 
then 
	./Auto-Plot-DP <Q2>  <-log(10,x)>  <directories...>
e.g.
	./Auto-Plot-DP 100 5 ./GBW/*
