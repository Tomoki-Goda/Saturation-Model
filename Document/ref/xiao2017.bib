abstract = {We study the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions at small-x in a consistent framework that takes into account the TMD evolution and small-x evolution simultaneously. The small-x evolution effects are included by computing the TMDs at appropriate scales in terms of the dipole scattering amplitudes, which obey the relevant Balitsky–Kovchegov equation. Meanwhile, the TMD evolution is obtained by resumming the Collins–Soper type large logarithms emerged from the calculations in small-x formalism into Sudakov factors.}
